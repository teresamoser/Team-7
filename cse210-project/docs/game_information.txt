What program are we going to create? 
Use your brainstorming from the solo checkpoint to answer this question together.

    # Bomb's Away!
Bomb's Away!: An arcade game where you control the tray of water at the bottom of 
the screen to catch all the falling bombs so the fuse is put out. The goal is not to miss one or they will explode and the round ends. 



What technologies will we use? 

    We will use the Python Arcade Library and will code the program in Python



What features will we include? 
The goal of asking this question is to identify what will and what won't be included. Use this simple feature planning guide to help you.

    #List features of Kaboom

    Main Features:
        bombs falling
        basket moves with user (mirror mouse move?)
        bombs speed up as time goes on (timed or by levels?)
    Extra Features (if we get to them):
        different types of bombs (bouncy ones, ones that don't fall straight down)
        user power-ups (shield, trampoline)
        Have more than just bombs fall down (random objects, objects that effect the user)
        Coins and shop system (buy more lives/speed between levels)



What is your timeline? 
The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to review the rest of the course schedule together.

    #map out milestones for each week
    Week 9: Get the display working, doesn't matter what it displays
    Week 10: Get the bombs to drop and the player to move with user mouse
    Week 11: Get the bombs to hurt user, add collection and point system (with game over)
    Week 12: Add special features like power ups and special bombs
    Week 13: Add even more special features like a shop system
